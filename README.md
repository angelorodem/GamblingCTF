# Online Gambling CTF
Someone told you about an hidden online gambling game, you gotta prove 'em you are a really good gambler too!

If you can, please use the Linux executable, windows cmd/pws does not support colors and will show alot of trash.

## Rules:
* No brute-forcing is needed to solve the flags.
* Do not spam the servers.
* Try not to create more than 3 Accounts.
* Do not try to portscan the server (there is nothing there).

## Flags:
```
1. I Have the power!    (Rumors have it that you can get high privileges)
2. Self Inviter         (Nobody invited you, but you came anyway)
3. I'm Immortal         (Someone can't get hacked that easily, learn it's power and become **The One**!)
4. HighBaller           (Prove others that you are really good at gambling (get absolute max score))
```
# Notes
* When you reach flag 3 & 4 the server will track your progress and show on the scoreboard.
* If you see a panic in loop it means connection problems <!-- there is no heartbeat -->.
